![main_screen](assets/fecreator.png?raw=true)

## Introduction
Thi iOS app was one of my first projects and it combines a game that I love called Fire Emblem and in that game you usually have an avatar character that you can customize.

## Creator
In the creator tab the user can choose their name, class, hair color, and gender. The user will type their name in the name text box where it will be saved. The user can flip through class options ranging from mages to soldiers and beyond. Each class contains a description and will show their strengths and weaknesses. Going down the screen, the user can tap buttons that will change their hair color and gender.

## Output
The output tab will neatly display the information that the user chose so they can take a screenshot or put it into their game.
